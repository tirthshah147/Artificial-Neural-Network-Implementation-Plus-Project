# Artificial-Neural-Network-Implementation-Plus-Project
ANN's implementation in Python from scratch. Initializing Random Weights, Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation and other algorithms are implemented from scratch without using any third-party Python library. Handwritten Digits Recognition with Neural Network Project is also there in the repository.
