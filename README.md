# Artificial-Neural-Network-Implementation-Plus-Project
Andrew Ng's course - logistic regression implementation in python. 

ANN's implementation in Python from scratch. Initializing Random Weights, Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation and other algorithms are implemented from scratch without using any third-party Python library. Handwritten Digits Recognition with Neural Network Project is also there in the repository.

So if you are doing Coursera's Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course and want to implement in Python then check this code.
